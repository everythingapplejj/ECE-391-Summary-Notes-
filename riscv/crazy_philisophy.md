# RISC-V Crazy Philisophy 

## Introduction

Risc-v is an open, free instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles.

so... what is it different from x86 (used in previous ECE 391 curriculum)? 


|  Name  | RISC-V            | x86 |
| :----- | :--------------: | --: |
| ISA  | Reduced Instruction Set Computer  | Complex Instruction Set Computer |
| Licensing Model    | Open - Source and Royalty - Free  | Proprietary and Closed |
| Instruction Length | Uses fixed - length Instruction | Uses variable - length instruction |
| Number of Registers and Design | 32 General Purpose Registers |  16 General Purpose Registers |



## History and Inception

**<mark>2010</mark>**: Under the direction of Professor Krste Asnovic and graduate students Yunsup Lee and Andrew Waterman, they decided to build a new, clean-slate ISA from the ground up. You know why? **They were extremely frustrated with the complexity and the licensing fees of existing commercial ISAs for their research!** So they just decided to make a better ISA :) 

**<mark>2015</mark>**: RISC-V Foundation was founded. The non-profit consortium included initial members like **Google, HP, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Qualcomm**.
